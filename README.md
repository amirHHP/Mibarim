# Release Notes

### 2015-10-15

* All fragments have been updated to support lib fragments.
* All activities are now AppCompat
* Dagger is updated to Dagger 2
* ButterKnife has been updated to 7.0.1
* Timer notification now shows the timer in the notification (useful for when someone does not have the app open)
* No ETA on the Material and RxJava implementation other than "when there is time". That magical time is wild stuff.

# UPDATE: 2014-11-18

* Mibarim is now API 15+ only.
* I will also be implementing RxJava, Material design and a few other things into this app as well.
There will be *no upgrade path* as Mibarim is mean to act as a starting point for Android Applications.
